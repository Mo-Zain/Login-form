# Login-form
My first time making a form using HTML. It hasn't been styled and only contains the basics.
I started learning HTML a few days ago I learnt how to make a login form and this is my attempt at making one.
I have made a lot more but they didn't work and so I changed each version slightly until I got this.
It only contains the barebones to make a login form.
