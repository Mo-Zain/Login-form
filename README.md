# Learning HTML
My first time making a form using HTML. The codes haven't been styled and only contain the basics.
I started learning HTML a few days ago, I learnt how to make a login form, a dashboard on a new tab, and a hame page, and theses are my attempts at making them.
The homepage doesn't look like a basic homepage because I was also using it to test out the different features available in HTML
It only contains the barebones to make a login form, a dashboard and a homepage.
